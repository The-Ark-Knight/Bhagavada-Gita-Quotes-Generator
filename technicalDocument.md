## Technical Document: Bhagavad Gita Quotes Generator

### Introduction

The Bhagavad Gita Quotes Generator is a Python script designed to load quotes from a JSON file and display a random quote. This technical document provides an overview of the code structure, explains the decisions made in its design, and discusses error handling and data validation.

### Code Structure

The code consists of three main parts:

1. **Loading Quotes (`load_quotes`):** This function is responsible for loading quotes from a JSON file and performing data validation.

2. **Getting a Random Quote (`get_random_quote`):** This function selects a random quote from the list of quotes and raises an error if no quotes are found.

3. **Displaying the Quote (`display_quote`):** This function is used to display the selected quote, whether it is a string or a dictionary containing a "text" field.

4. **Main Execution (`if __name__ == "__main__"):** This part of the code orchestrates the entire process. It loads quotes, gets a random quote, and displays it. It also includes error handling for potential issues.

### Decisions and Design

1. **Modular Design:** The code is structured into modular functions, which enhances readability and maintainability. Each function has a specific responsibility, making it easier to identify and address potential issues.

2. **Error Handling:** Error handling has been implemented to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code. Specifically, the code deals with `FileNotFoundError` and `ValueError`. This ensures a more robust and user-friendly experience.

3. **Data Validation:** Data validation is a critical aspect of the code. The `load_quotes` function validates that the loaded JSON data is a list, and the `get_random_quote` function ensures that there are quotes to choose from. These measures prevent unexpected behavior due to invalid data.

### Error Handling and Data Validation

#### Error Handling:

- The `FileNotFoundError` is caught when attempting to open the JSON file. It provides a clear error message if the file is not found.

- The `ValueError` is raised in cases of invalid data or when no quotes are available. This ensures that the user is informed about any issues with the data.

#### Data Validation:

- The `load_quotes` function validates that the loaded JSON data is a list. If the data is not in the expected format, a `ValueError` is raised to alert the user about the issue.

- The `get_random_quote` function checks if there are quotes to choose from. If the quotes list is empty, a `ValueError` is raised, preventing the code from attempting to select a quote that doesn't exist.

### Conclusion

The Bhagavad Gita Quotes Generator is designed to be robust, user-friendly, and maintainable. By following a modular structure and implementing error handling and data validation, the code ensures a reliable and informative experience for users while interacting with Bhagavad Gita quotes.
